## About Me

I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer with hands-on experience in building scalable applications, secure backend systems, and interactive user interfaces. My work spans frontend engineering, backend API development, database design, automation, and the development of real-world applications using modern JavaScript and Python frameworks.

In my recent roles and projects, I have engineered production-ready systems including a secure task-management backend built with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and MySQL, implementing JWT-based authentication and role-based access control. I have also developed full-stack applications such as AI-powered recipe generation systems, SaaS-based portfolio builders, and optimized service-workflow platforms.

My background includes developing modular REST APIs, integrating cloud-based storage solutions, handling large datasets, and implementing reliable client-server communication patterns. I also have experience building intelligent web-scraping systems, machine-learning–driven features, and automation pipelines for data processing.

I am particularly interested in scalable backend architectures, API engineering, workflow automation, and designing systems that combine AI capabilities with efficient full-stack development.
